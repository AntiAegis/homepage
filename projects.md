## Object-Detection Network Compression
*Conducted at Cyber Core when I were a machine-learning engineer*
* **Time**: Jun 2019 -- now
* **Role**: Member of a team of 6 members, in which, I were responsible for reading and implementing recent papers.
* **Description**: We have researched techniques to compress a powerful network to a tiny one with 8% of the original GFLOPs without sacrificing the original accuracy. This project is a contract between [Cyber Core](http://cybercore.co.jp/) and [Toyota Research Institute Advanced Development](https://www.tri-ad.global/) for building a module in autonomous cars.
* **Result**: Network architecture was designed that meets two criteria of GFLOPs and accuracy. A final quantization step is being conducted.

## Image Forgery Classification and Segmentation: A Unified Deep-Learning Approach
*Bachelor thesis*
* **Time**: Jan 2019 – Jun 2019
* **Role**: Leader of a team with two members.
* **Description**: We proposed a unified deep-learning network which can perform classification and segmentation simultaneously. Besides, we also derived a loss function
for overcoming data imbalance.
* **Result**: In comparison, there are two tasks. The proposed method surpasses recent methods (up to 2018) for 3/5 public datasets on task1, and 5/5 public datasets on task2.

## Pornographic Activity Detection
*Conducted at Zalo AILab when I were a data-mining collaborator*
* **Time**: Mar 2018 – May 2019
* **Role**: Main contributor (e.g., collecting data, organizing data, training model, deploying model, evaluating model).
* **Description**: I had built up a pipeline, including image-classification network, text-detection network, OCR network, and text-classification model, to detect users who were carrying out pornographic activities on Zalo.
* **Result**: The pipeline has been deployed live in Zalo.

## Human Segmentation
*Conducted at Zalo AILab when I were a data-mining collaborator*
* **Time**: Dec 2018 – Apr 2019
* **Role**: Share an equal contribution with a colleague.
* **Description**: We had explored and developed a realtime mobile app which can segment human body and replace background in livestream videos.
* **Result**: A base model is available (25 FPS on single core, 91% mIoU on our dataset).

## Face Attendance Checking System
[https://github.com/thuyngch/Face-Attendance-System](https://github.com/thuyngch/Face-Attendance-System)
* **Time**: Sep 2018 – Nov 2018
* **Role**: Leader of a team with 6 members.
* **Description**: My team had designed an Attendance Checking application using face to distinguish individuals.
* **Result**: The algorithm can be run realtime on popular laptops (in CPU mode). It is
also accurate at 96.5%.

## Things Classifier
*Conducted at Zalo AILab when I were a data-mining collaborator*
* **Time**: Jul 2018 – Nov 2018
* **Role**: Major contributor (e.g., collecting data, organizing data, training model, evaluating model).
* **Description**: I had built up a module that can automatically classify images uploaded by users. It is part of a system to understand users’ interests.
* **Result**: The module has been deployed live in Zalo.

## Image Forgery Detection using Deep Learning
[https://github.com/thuyngch/Image-Forgery-using-Deep-Learning](https://github.com/thuyngch/Image-Forgery-using-Deep-Learning)
* **Time**: Jun 2018 – Nov 2018
* **Role**: Leader of a team with 3 members.
* **Description**: This was a research contract with HCMUT. My team had researched on Deep Learning techniques applied for Image Forgery Detection problem.
* **Result**: Our model can detect forged images with high accuracy of 95.15%.

## Event Information Extraction from Flyers
[https://github.com/thuyngch/Event-info-extraction-from-flyers](https://github.com/thuyngch/Event-info-extraction-from-flyers)
* **Time**: Sep 2017 – Oct 2017
* **Role**: Algorithm development.
* **Description**: This was a project with 2 classmates in the course ”Digital Image Processing”. Our work was reading a paper from the Standford university and then realizing it into code.
* **Result**: A Matlab GUI extracting important information of events as text (e.g. time and location) from poster or flyer images.

------
## Iris Recognition
[https://github.com/thuyngch/Iris-Recognition](https://github.com/thuyngch/Iris-Recognition)
* **Time**: Jun 2017 – Dec 2017
* **Role**: Leader of a team with 6 members.
* **Description**: My team had conducted a research on Iris Recognition to recognize identities of people by using their iris images.
* **Result**: Two versions of Iris Recognition application in both Python and Matlab. An MIT-license repository is published in GitHub and received many interests from the community.
