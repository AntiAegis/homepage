## 3D Dangerous Object Detection using Milliwave Radar
*Conducted at CyberCore when I were a project manager*
* **Time**: Jun 2020 -- now
* **Role**: Leader of a team with 6 members.
* **Description**: Cooperate with [Taiyo Yuden](https://www.yuden.co.jp/eu/) to develop a security product for early alert at airports. It uses a network of various milliwave radars to detect dangerous objects (e.g., knife, gun) inside clothes.
* **Result**: In progress.

## Waymo Open Dataset Challenge 2020
[https://github.com/thuyngch/DSTNet](https://github.com/thuyngch/DSTNet)

*Conducted at CyberCore when I were a machine-learning engineer*
* **Time**: Apr 2020 -- May 2020
* **Role**: Leader of a team with 3 members.
* **Description**: We participated the challenge as a company team. The problem is detecting and tracking objects (e.g., car, pedestrian, and cyclist) on the road, which is systematically a visual module in autonomous-driving vehicles.
* **Result**: Rank 5th in [2D-Tracking](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/2d-tracking/) and Rank 10th in [2D-Detection](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/2d-detection).

## Out-of-distribution Object Detection
*Conducted at CyberCore when I were a machine-learning engineer*
* **Time**: Jan 2020 -- Mar 2020
* **Role**: Major contributor of a team of 4 members, in which, I were responsible for reading, implementing, and improving SOTA papers.
* **Description**: We have researched techniques to make a network being able to detect unknown objects (not seen in training set and may be harmful if being detected wrongly). This project is a contract between [CyberCore](http://cybercore.co.jp/) and [Toyota Research Institute Advanced Development](https://www.tri-ad.global/) for building a module in autonomous cars.
* **Result**: The project was passed the PoC phase.

## Object-Detection Network Compression
*Conducted at Cyber Core when I were a machine-learning engineer*
* **Time**: Jun 2019 -- Dec 2019
* **Role**: Member of a team of 6 members, in which, I were responsible for reading and implementing SOTA papers.
* **Description**: We had researched techniques to compress a powerful network to a tiny one with 8% of the original GFLOPs without sacrificing the original accuracy. This project is a contract between [CyberCore](http://cybercore.co.jp/) and [Toyota Research Institute Advanced Development](https://www.tri-ad.global/) for building a module in autonomous cars.
* **Result**: The project was finalized and delivered to Toyota.

## Vehicle Management System
*Conducted personally*
* **Time**: Aug 2019 -- Dec 2019
* **Role**: Leader of a team with 4 members. I designed system architecture and was particularly responsible for AI core.
* **Description**: We had built a system to manage in/out information (vehicle image, licence plate, in-time, out-time, etc.) of vehicles in the Unilever factory.
* **Result**: The project was finalized and delivered to [Unilever Vietnam](https://www.unilever.com.vn/). The system has been deployed live at Unilever factory in Cu Chi district, HoChiMinh city.

## Image Forgery Classification and Segmentation: A Unified Deep-Learning Approach
*Bachelor thesis*
* **Time**: Jan 2019 – Jun 2019
* **Role**: Leader of a team with two members.
* **Description**: We proposed a unified deep-learning network which can perform classification and segmentation simultaneously. Besides, we also derived a loss function
for overcoming data imbalance.
* **Result**: In comparison, there are two tasks. The proposed method surpasses recent methods (up to 2018) for 3/5 public datasets on task1, and 5/5 public datasets on task2.

## Pornographic Activity Detection
*Conducted at Zalo AILab when I were a data-mining collaborator*
* **Time**: Mar 2018 – May 2019
* **Role**: Main contributor (e.g., collecting data, organizing data, training model, deploying model, evaluating model).
* **Description**: I had built up a pipeline, including image-classification network, text-detection network, OCR network, and text-classification model, to detect users who were carrying out pornographic activities on Zalo.
* **Result**: The pipeline has been deployed live in Zalo.

------
## Human Segmentation
*Conducted at Zalo AILab when I were a data-mining collaborator*
* **Time**: Dec 2018 – Apr 2019
* **Role**: Share an equal contribution with a colleague.
* **Description**: We had explored and developed a realtime mobile app which can segment human body and replace background in livestream videos.
* **Result**: A base model is available (25 FPS on single core, 91% mIoU on our dataset).

## Face Attendance Checking System
[https://github.com/thuyngch/Face-Attendance-System](https://github.com/thuyngch/Face-Attendance-System)
* **Time**: Sep 2018 – Nov 2018
* **Role**: Leader of a team with 6 members.
* **Description**: My team had designed an Attendance Checking application using face to distinguish individuals.
* **Result**: The algorithm can be run realtime on popular laptops (in CPU mode). It is
also accurate at 96.5%.

------
## Things Classifier
*Conducted at Zalo AILab when I were a data-mining collaborator*
* **Time**: Jul 2018 – Nov 2018
* **Role**: Major contributor (e.g., collecting data, organizing data, training model, evaluating model).
* **Description**: I had built up a module that can automatically classify images uploaded by users. It is part of a system to understand users’ interests.
* **Result**: The module has been deployed live in Zalo.
