I am Thuy Nguyen Chinh (first, last, and middle name) from Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. I have recently received my bachelor degree with honor program in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at the Ho Chi Minh city University of Technology.

Currently, I am working for companies, applying Deep Learning to solve Computer Vision problems. Besides, I also take part in research group at the university with my professor ([Prof. Thuong Le Tien](https://sites.google.com/site/thuongtienle/)). My topics of interest are Object Detection, Image Segmentation, Object Tracking, Image Forensics, and Biometrics.
